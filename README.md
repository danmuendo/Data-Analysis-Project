# ZFS Loan Data Analysis - Part 1: Data Cleaning and Exploration (Python Code)

This project focuses on the initial stage of analyzing Zappy Financial Services' (ZFS's) historical loan data - data cleaning and exploration. The provided Python code streamlines these tasks, offering valuable insights into applicant profiles, loan performance trends, and factors influencing loan approvals.

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
pandas library (pip install pandas)
Optional (for processing PDF applications):

tabula-py library (pip install tabula-py)
# Instructions:

## Clone or download this repository.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pip install pandas). Install tabula-py (pip install tabula-py) if you have PDF loan applications.
Replace "Loan_Data.xlsx" and "Loan_Application.pdf" (if applicable) in the code with the actual paths to your data files.
Run the Python script (main.py or your equivalent script name) to execute the data cleaning and exploration pipeline.
Functionality
The code performs the following tasks:

### Data Loading:

Loads data from Excel spreadsheets using pandas.read_excel().
Optionally extracts data from PDF loan application forms using tabula-py (if available).
Combines data from multiple sources (Excel and PDF) into a single DataFrame (if applicable).
### Data Cleaning:

Identifies and handles missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
Applies data cleaning techniques like imputation or removal of rows with excessive missing values (customizable).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Provides functionalities for calculating summary statistics and basic data visualization (implementation details may vary).
Note: Model building for loan prediction is not included in this part but recommended for future development (see full project Read Me for details).

### Code Structure
The code adheres to a modular approach, with functions for:

Loading data from Excel and PDF (if applicable)
Cleaning the data
Performing basic EDA tasks (specific functionalities may vary)
This structure improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

### Additional Notes
Ensure proper data security and privacy practices when handling ZFS's loan data.
Regularly review and update the code to maintain compatibility with evolving libraries and data formats.
By effectively cleaning and exploring the loan data, this project empowers ZFS to gain a deeper understanding of its borrowers and loan performance, paving the way for more informed decision-making in the future.
